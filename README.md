# MediChain

Welcome to MediChain, where we are revolutionizing healthcare by integrating blockchain technology. Our platform utilizes blockchain to create unique patient IDs, which securely store essential patient information including their name, age, date of birth, address, medical history, diagnosis and treatment details, as well as prescriptions and medications.

To begin your journey with MediChain, we recommend exploring the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Rest assured that any modifications or experimentation you perform within your development environment will not impact any production deployments or identity tokens.

By leveraging blockchain, we aim to enhance the security, privacy, and accessibility of patient data, ultimately empowering healthcare providers with comprehensive and reliable information. We are excited to have you on board as we advance the future of healthcare together.

We are  participating in the Parul Let's Hack (India Tour) event. Check out the event details at [Parul Let's Hack (India Tour)](https://parulletshack.devfolio.co/).
